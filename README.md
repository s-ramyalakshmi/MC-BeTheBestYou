CSE 535 - MC project

Overview of my project - 

Our Guardian Angel project focuses on holistic user well-being, encompassing physical health, mental health, and personal goals. It offers a comprehensive health solution with anomaly detection, suggesting nearby medical facilities, and initiating contact with emergency contacts in critical situations.

My project 4 aligns with the Guardian angel by focusing on the mental health and personal goals parts of the Project 5. In mental health monitoring the user has to answer two questionnaires for anxiety and depression. In personal goals page depending on the goal the user wants to achieve they get recommendations.
